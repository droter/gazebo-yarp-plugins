gazebo_yarp_robotinterface
==========================

The `gazebo_yarp_robotinterface` plugin permits to load several [YARP devices]() that can be attached to YARP devices 
already opened by other Gazebo-YARP plugins using the same XML format used by the [`yarprobotinterface`](http://www.yarp.it/git-master/yarprobotinterface.html) tool and the [`libYARP_robotinterface` C++ library](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/tree/master/src/libYARP_robotinterface).
